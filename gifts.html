      <h2>Happy Valentine’s Day ❤️</h2>
      <p>It all started as a friend. Our fights and laughter made me realize how much you mean to me. The first possessiveness I felt for you was the beginning of my love for you. I didn't know I was falling in love with you until you said you loved me too. We had come all the way together holding so much love.</p>

      <h2>You Are My Sunshine ☀️</h2>
      <p>The transition we had from friendship to love was seamless. You are my sunshine, my joy, and my everything. Though it was tough all the way along it was worth it because of you. I only need you and nothing else. </p>
